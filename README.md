# The Link Between GDP and Life Expectancy: What Six Countries Reveal

**By Bikesh Suwal**

## Introduction

Does money make us live longer? Itâ€™s a simple question with a surprisingly complex answer. To explore the connection between a countryâ€™s economic performance and the health of its citizens, I analyzed data from the **World Bank** and **World Health Organization** for six countries between **2000 and 2015**.

Using Python and powerful libraries like **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**, I visualized the trends in **GDP** and **life expectancy**. The results reveal patterns that are both expected and enlightening â€” and in some cases, unexpected.

## The Data

The dataset includes:

* **Countries**: Chile, China, Germany, Mexico, United States, Zimbabwe
* **Metrics**: Gross Domestic Product (GDP in USD) and life expectancy at birth (in years)
* **Time Range**: 2000â€“2015

The goal was to see how economic growth (GDP) correlates with life expectancy across different economic and geopolitical contexts.

## ðŸ“ˆ Life Expectancy Trends

All six countries show **rising life expectancy** over the 15-year period.

* **Germany** and **Chile** consistently have high life expectancy.
* **Zimbabwe** shows the **most dramatic improvement**, rebounding from very low levels in the early 2000s.
* The **United States** increases steadily but lags slightly behind some other high-GDP countries in longevity.

## ðŸ’° GDP Trends

As expected:

* The **United States** and **Germany** lead with the highest GDP.
* **China** shows **rapid economic growth** â€” a near quadrupling in GDP over the period.
* **Zimbabwe** and **Haiti** (if included) remain economically behind the others.

##  GDP vs. Life Expectancy

This scatterplot reveals a **positive correlation**:

> Countries with higher GDP tend to have longer life expectancy.

However:

* **The U.S. has very high GDP but not the highest life expectancy**, highlighting that money alone isn't everything.
* **Zimbabwe** defies the odds: while its GDP remains low, life expectancy **improves sharply**, suggesting that **public health initiatives** or **international aid** may play a key role.

## Key Insights

1. **Wealth generally correlates with health**, but it's not a perfect relationship.
2. **Rapid GDP growth** (e.g., China) is often accompanied by **health improvements**.
3. **Social and healthcare systems** matter â€” as seen in Zimbabweâ€™s gains without much economic growth.
4. The **United States** may underperform in life expectancy relative to its GDP, raising questions about inequality, healthcare access, or lifestyle factors.

## Conclusion

GDP and life expectancy are connected â€” but not perfectly. While richer countries tend to have healthier populations, other factors like healthcare access, education, infrastructure, and policy can have just as big an impact.

This analysis shows that **economic growth creates opportunity**, but **smart investment in public health delivers results**.
